<h3> Area </h3>
<br>
You are to write a program that computes the area of a rectangle delimited by the surrounding path.<br>
<br>
The path is always closed and runs along the grid lines, i.e. between the squares of the grid. You can safely assume that the path never touches or crosses itself.<br>
<br>
<h3> Input Specification </h3>
<br>
The first line of the input file contains the number of test cases in the file. Each test case that follows consists of two lines.<br>
<br>
The first line of each case contains two integer numbers <span class="span-cls">X</span> and <span class="span-cls">Y</span> specifying the starting point of the path.<br>
<br>
The second line contains a string of variable length. Every letter in the string symbolizes a move of length one along the grid. Only the letters ’<span class="span-cls">W</span>’ (”west”), ’<span class="span-cls">E</span>’ (”east”), ’<span class="span-cls">N</span>’ (”north”), ’<span class="span-cls">S</span>’ (”south”), and ’<span class="span-cls">.</span>’ (”end of path”, no move) appear in the string.<br>
<br>
The end-of-path character (’<span class="span-cls">.</span>’) is immediately followed by the end of the line. The length of each input line will never exceed 100000 characters.  <br>
<br>
<h3> Output Specification </h3>
<br>
For each test case, output must contain one single line with the text <span class="span-cls">The area is XX squares.</span> - the letters XX should be replaced by the computed area of the given polygon.  <br>
